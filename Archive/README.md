These plugins were early attempts at implementing the Surface Cut filter.

 <summary> <strong> SurfaceCut-ImplicitSelectionLoop (Archived) </strong> </summary>
This plugin cuts the brain surface along the curves generated by the surface tracking filter. It uses vtk filter Implicit Selection Loop along with the clip filter to extract the inner region of the loop. Documentation for implicit selection loop can be found here: https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkImplicitSelectionLoop.html, and this is an example using it: https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Cxx/PolyData/ImplicitSelectionLoop/  

  **Input**: 
  - *pipeline browser*:
    - Brain surface that is being processed (vtkPolyData); usually rendered from a BYU file
    - Output of the Surface Tracker filter (vtkPolyData) that consists of a closed loop of points  

  **Output**: A vtkPolyData that is the extracted region.

**Notes**:
 - This method currently doesn't work too well. It relies on the calculation of the implicit function value of each point. There is a clip function which when set to 0, will clip out the positive region (cells outside the loop will have positive implicit function values). However, I suspect this doesn't work too well because the surface itself is irregular and this may only work well for conical or spherical-shaped objects.
 - The results of this filter are variable, but it often doesn't capture the entire region you specified or captures too much.

 <summary> <strong> SurfaceCut-ConnectedComponents (Archived) </strong> </summary>
This plugin is similar in functionality to the SurfaceCut-ImplicitSelectionLoop plugin, but it uses a different algorithm to extract the region inside the loop. We first build an adjacency list to keep track of each vertex's neighbors. Next, we split the brain surface into two components by deleting the cells that are in contact with the vertices along the user-specified path. The plugin also takes as input a vertex that isn't inside the loop, so that we can find all reachable vertices from that outside vertex and remove those from the graph.

  **Input**:
  - *pipeline browser*:
    - Brain surface that is being processed (vtkPolyData); usually rendered from a BYU file
    - Output of the Surface Tracker filter (vtkPolyData) that consists of a closed loop of points
    - An outside point (vtkUnstructuredGrid): obtained by selecting a point oustide of the desired region (using the interactive select points on tool) and extracting this selection  

  **Output**: A vtkPolyData that is the extracted region.

**Notes**:
 - This method is more consistent than the implicit selection loop + clip method, but it takes longer to run (around 30 seconds).
 - Another downside is that it truncates the region of interest slightly, but still retains most of its general outline.
 - You can use the loop subdivison filter to increase the granularity of the mesh (split each existing triangle into more triangles), but then the plugin takes significantly longer to run.
